# Challenges
  
One of the first challenges that had to be solved after finishing User Authentication would be understanding how to have users be able to upload their own photo. To solve this, I first focused on creating the Upload Form on the frontend, then focused on creating the correct backend calls and tested it to see that upon hitting the upload form I was able to retrieve the uploaded data. From there, I focused on creating an Amazon Bucket to handle all the new uploaded Images!
